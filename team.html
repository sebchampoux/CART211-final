Bob, the founder. A true visionary, he was originally made to be served for pasta in Whiterun. But unlike the other meatballs, Bob had big ideas, and a dream. A dream to go out and explore the world. Eventually, he left his bowl and got out of Whiterun, moving south towards Falkreath. During his journey he encountered many trolls, bandits, dragons, and a pesky dragonborn, but nothing could stop him, he had a burning feeling that he was destined for greatness, and nothing in the world would stand in his way. He was an adventurer, until he took an arrow in the knee. Thomas the Tank engine had spotted the young meatball and decided to incapacitate him in order to promptly rob him. Thomas took all of Bobs possessions and  left him in a cave to die, alone. And that's when Bob was struck with innovation, that cave inspired him, and thus he decided to start his mining business. He took a stimpak he found conveniently in that cave and healed his crippled leg. He continued his journey, this time heading towards Markarth and founded his new company: Meatballs Inc. He started small, with just one base of operations and 20 slaves. Fast forward 150 years later and he was able to consistently grow his company. Now using about 5000 slaves in each base of operations… until a man known as Viktor Reznov organized an escape and completely ruined Bobs plans… and then people began seeing slavery as a bad thing which worsened situations even more for Bob. But Bob wasn't one to give up easily. He was a man of action, and thus he thought… if he can't exploit the basic rights of a normal human… then he could try and exploit the rights of mother earth. And thus he began to reform his company. He tore down trees, blew up mines, burnt down forests, took down 3 of the 16 colossi and overloaded the chunks of his minecraft server in order to duplicate his items. After 10 years of random operations, he took a break, and decided to reflect upon his life decisions.. Something was missing for him… but what? One day while flying his dragon he crash landed into the ice and was frozen solid for an entire millenium. While frozen, he pondered… wondered what was missing in his life now. Suddenly, it finally, it came to him: He missed his mining roots. Now, reborn with a new sense of purpose he escaped the ice and went out into the new millennium, ready to start a new dream. But the world had changed, he grew up a medieval meatball, and was now stuck in the modern times. That's where the sons come in, and with their recruitment and a new fire to keep the mining business in order, Köttbullar and Sons was created.

		The Sons
	</h2>
	The sons are the best partners that Bob could have asked for. They are cunning, thoughtful, resourceful and most importantly, they have no moral code whatsoever! After Bob awoke from the ice and went back to live in a society, he found himself dumbfounded by the new ways of the world. The sons were hired in order to help him learn how to survive in the world, and in order to help take the company into new heights it had never seen before. Finally achieving a new employee high of 5 workers instead of 4.

	<li>His cunning is unmatched, he's handsome as fruitcakes, he's got quite the mess of hair and he probably needs a haircut. But he doesn't give a crap about that. He knows that he'll get the job done no matter what because like Bob, he doesn't care about your feelings and only cares about profits! He's constantly looking for new ways to exploit the system and take away as many pennies out of your pocket as is physically possible. Manipulation and robbery are some of his finest skills. He is also a level 100 white night and will respect wamen at any cost.</li>

	<li>She's funny, smart and independent. Hardworking when you need her to and she never deletes big portions of work by accident. Her marketing skills are legendary and she'll hit anyone who threatens the company with an Ok Boomer. Some people wonder if she's an assassin or something but just don't ask too many questions and you'll prolly be fine. When it comes to employee satisfaction, you can bet your asses she'll pay them less than minimum wage at any chance. She's the team visionary in relevance and memes </li>

	<li>He's the smartest of the bunch, able to crunch up codes in less than 5 minutes. One of his best skills is that he possesses the ability to count to 5 in 5 seconds. He has a power level of over 9000 when it comes to JavaScript, and he's reliable. Whether he's in a cave or at the edge of the universe, he'll find a way to come up with a plan and go through with it. He tends to be such a genius that he might include smart elements that he didn't even notice, making him the head of the research team which consists of 1 member. His glasses give him an extra 50% boost to all smarts and brain, and he knows da wae. Plus he has a bonus 100% resistance to cold weather and he likes Doge. He's a valuable and essential asset to the company and will always have your back.</li>

	Lets be honest, nobody really cares about our lazy excuse of a staff. They might be people but they sold their lives and souls to us so whatever.

We dont have any facilities, we are constantly on the run from enviromentalists, the law and the FBI since apparently for some reason people dont like when you burn down forests and refuse to pay your employees. If you ask us, they're just a bunch of sissies. But the good thing is that since were always moving our operations are pretty much all over the world, so while yes, its false marketing, we will keep advertising that we operate globally since here we dont really care about the consumer nor the environment. We care about profits, lots of profits... and to quote Bob: "Sometimes the correct way... is not the most profitable" Thus here is an image of a god who also loves money
